# TODO: Convert Hono Cloudflare Worker to Effect

## Phase 1: Effect Services Setup

### 1.1 Create Core Services

- [ ] **HttpClient Service** - Replace native fetch with Effect-based HTTP client

  - Create service interface for HTTP operations
  - Implement fetch wrapper with proper error handling
  - Add caching support for Cloudflare cache API

- [ ] **KVStorage Service** - Wrap Cloudflare KV operations

  - Create service interface for KV operations (get, put, delete)
  - Implement proper error handling for KV failures
  - Add type-safe operations for ArticleSummary storage

- [ ] **AI Service** - Wrap Cloudflare AI binding
  - Create service interface for AI operations
  - Implement summarization with proper error handling
  - Add fallback mechanisms for AI failures

### 1.2 Environment Services

- [ ] **Environment Service** - Manage Cloudflare bindings
  - Create service to access KV, AI, and other bindings
  - Ensure type safety for environment variables
  - Handle missing bindings gracefully

## Phase 2: Convert Business Logic to Effect

### 2.1 Hacker News Feed Processing

- [ ] **Convert getFeed() function**
  - Rewrite `src/lib/hacker-news.ts` to use Effect
  - Use HttpClient service instead of direct fetch
  - Add proper error handling and retries
  - Return Effect<FeedEntryWithComments[], FeedError>

### 2.2 Article Processing

- [ ] **Convert getArticleAndSummary() function**
  - Rewrite `src/lib/article.ts` to use Effect
  - Use KVStorage and HttpClient services
  - Implement proper error handling for each step:
    - KV cache lookup
    - Article fetching
    - HTML parsing
    - Content cleaning
    - AI summarization
    - KV cache storage
  - Return Effect<ArticleSummary, ArticleError>

### 2.3 Error Types

- [ ] **Define comprehensive error types**
  - Create error types for each service (HttpError, KVError, AIError)
  - Create domain-specific errors (FeedError, ArticleError)
  - Implement proper error messages and codes

## Phase 3: Effect Integration with Hono

### 3.1 Runtime Setup

- [ ] **Create Effect Runtime for Cloudflare Workers**
  - Set up Effect runtime that works with CF Workers
  - Configure proper resource management
  - Handle worker lifecycle correctly

### 3.2 Service Providers

- [ ] **Create service layer providers**
  - Implement all services with real CF bindings
  - Create service composition/dependency injection
  - Ensure proper service lifecycle management

### 3.3 Route Handlers

- [ ] **Convert Hono route handlers to use Effect**
  - Modify main route (`/`) to use Effect programs
  - Implement proper error handling in routes
  - Maintain JSX rendering compatibility
  - Convert async/await to Effect.runPromise

## Phase 4: Advanced Effect Features

### 4.1 Concurrency and Performance

- [ ] **Implement concurrent article processing**
  - Use Effect.forEach with concurrency control
  - Optimize parallel article fetching and processing
  - Add proper resource pooling

### 4.2 Caching Strategy

- [ ] **Enhanced caching with Effect**
  - Implement cache-aside pattern with Effect
  - Add cache invalidation strategies
  - Use Effect scheduling for cache management

### 4.3 Observability

- [ ] **Add Effect observability**
  - Implement proper logging with Effect
  - Add metrics and tracing
  - Use Effect's built-in telemetry features

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

### 5.1 Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] **Set up Effect testing**
  - Create test services/mocks
  - Write unit tests for Effect programs
  - Test error scenarios and edge cases

### 5.2 Integration Testing

- [ ] **Test CF Worker integration**
  - Test with real CF environment
  - Validate KV operations work correctly
  - Test AI integration (if enabled)

## Phase 6: Documentation and Cleanup

### 6.1 Code Documentation

- [ ] **Document Effect patterns used**
  - Add JSDoc comments to Effect programs
  - Document service interfaces
  - Create usage examples

### 6.2 Project Cleanup

- [ ] **Clean up old code**
  - Remove old async/await patterns
  - Update imports and dependencies
  - Ensure consistent code style

### 6.3 Deployment

- [ ] **Update deployment configuration**
  - Ensure wrangler.toml is compatible
  - Test deployment pipeline
  - Validate production behavior

## Notes

### Key Effect Patterns to Use:

- **Service Pattern**: For dependency injection and testability
- **Error Handling**: Use Effect's tagged errors for better error management
- **Resource Management**: Use Effect.acquireRelease for proper cleanup
- **Concurrency**: Use Effect.forEach and Effect.all for parallel operations
- **Retries**: Use Effect.retry for robust error recovery

### Migration Strategy:

1. Start with services (Phase 1)
2. Convert business logic incrementally (Phase 2)
3. Integrate with Hono gradually (Phase 3)
4. Add advanced features (Phase 4)
5. Test thoroughly (Phase 5)
6. Clean up and document (Phase 6)

### Dependencies to Consider:

- `@effect/platform` - for HTTP client and other platform services
- `@effect/schema` - for data validation and parsing
- Consider Effect's ecosystem packages for additional functionality

- **Testability**: Service-based architecture makes testing much easier
- **Type Safety**: Better type safety throughout the application
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management

### Next Steps (Optional - Phase 4+):

- Add retry strategies for failed requests
- Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
- Add metrics and monitoring
- Write comprehensive tests
- Add AI summarization when CF AI is configured
